# Leveraging Data and Visualization to Understand the 2024 Brazil Floods

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize data related to the 2024 Brazil floods, providing insights into their causes, impacts, and possible mitigation strategies. By leveraging geospatial analysis, statistical modeling, and interactive visualizations, we seek to enhance understanding and decision-making in disaster management and response.

## Objectives
- Collect and preprocess flood-related datasets from various sources (satellite imagery, weather reports, government databases, etc.).
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and trends.
- Use geospatial tools to map flood-affected areas.
- Develop interactive visualizations for better data representation.
- Provide insights on flood mitigation and preparedness strategies.

## Data Sources
- **Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET)** – Weather data and historical trends.
- **NASA/ESA Satellite Imagery** – Remote sensing data for flood detection.
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** – Infrastructure and population density mapping.
- **Government & NGO Reports** – Official assessments and humanitarian impact reports.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Acquire raw datasets from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, standardize formats, and prepare for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify trends and correlations using statistical methods.
4. **Geospatial Mapping** – Utilize GIS tools (e.g., QGIS, Google Earth Engine) for spatial analysis.
5. **Visualization** – Implement dashboards using Python (Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit) for interactive insights.
6. **Interpretation & Insights** – Provide actionable recommendations based on findings.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Geopandas)
- **Geospatial Tools:** QGIS, Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS
- **Data Visualization:** Dash, Streamlit, Tableau
- **Machine Learning (if applicable):** Scikit-learn for predictive modeling

## Expected Outcomes
- Interactive maps highlighting flood-affected regions.
- Graphs and visualizations of rainfall patterns, temperature anomalies, and flood severity.
- Insights into the socio-economic impact of the floods.
- Recommendations for future flood resilience and response planning.
